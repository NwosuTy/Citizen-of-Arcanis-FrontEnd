#speaker: NPC  
Did you see the sky this morning?  

#speaker: Player  
What about it?  

#speaker: NPC  
Colors were shifting. Like something was bending the light.  

#speaker: Player  
Could’ve been a storm rolling in.  

#speaker: NPC  
Or something worse. You ever hear stories about ships that never land? Ones that hover just out of sight?  

#speaker: Player  
Sounds like a tall tale.  

#speaker: NPC  
Maybe. Or maybe they’re just waiting for something… or someone.
